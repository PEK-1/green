T# Sales Dashboard

A modern sales dashboard built with *Next.js 15, **TypeScript, and **TailwindCSS* demonstrating an atomic design architecture. The app visualizes sales data for 2022, 2023, and 2024 with interactive charts using the *Recharts* library.

## What I Did in This Project

- Set up a Next.js 15 project with TypeScript and TailwindCSS for styling.
- Applied *Atomic Design principles* by structuring components into *Atoms, **Molecules, and **Organisms* folders for better modularity and maintainability.
- Created mock sales data covering three years (2022-2024).
- Built reusable chart components using *Recharts* to display sales data as bar, line, and pie charts.
- Implemented a filter input to allow users to set a sales threshold filter.
- Added a chart type switcher for users to toggle between different chart visualizations.
- Created a clean, responsive dashboard page integrating all components.
- Prepared for future enhancements like API integration and additional interactive features.
